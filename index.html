        <p>Poverty alleviation through employment 
            (Goal 8 SDG: Decent Work and Economic Growth) The problem statement is to 
            promote long term, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive 
            employment, and decent work for all. Our goal is to provide jobs for people who are 
            living in poverty and are unable to escape due to a lack of job opportunities and 
            knowledge. It is relevant to the SDGs.</p>
